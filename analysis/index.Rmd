The goal of this website is to explore the software used in weighted gene co-expression network analysis, [WGCNA](https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/sagmb.2005.4.issue-1/sagmb.2005.4.1.1128/sagmb.2005.4.1.1128.pdf). 

Briefly, this software is designed to find connections between multiple genes, based on their gene expression. WGCNA provides a framework for constructing co-expression networks. In gene co-expression networks, each gene is represented by a node. In weighted gene networks, the strength of the connection is based on the similiarity of their gene expression (as measured by the Pearson correlation matrix). To read more about calculating gene co-expression networks, see the theory papers [here](https://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/). There is also interest in integrating gene co-expression network data with other traits, such as weight. 

In the [first WGCNA tutorial in R](https://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/Tutorials/), I analyzed a dataset of microarray-based gene expression measurements from 135 female mice. In addition to microarray data from each of the mice, there are also 25 body and metabolic-related traits, such as weight and glucose level. I am interested in identifying which genes/group of genes contribute most to each of these traits. For an overview of this process and a typical workflow, see [this short paper](https://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/Tutorials/Simulated-00-Background.pdf).

Future plans: Complete the [second WGCNA tutorial](https://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/Tutorials/). It covers directly comparing co-expression networks and traits for 2 or more datasets, e.g. case-control, before-after treatment as well as more visualizations.
